!The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) is the merged satellite
!and gauge precipitation products, made avaiable at NOAA/National Centers for
!Environmental Information. The Daily Precipitation Analysis Climate Data 
!Record (CDR) is a companion to the GPCP Monthly analysis at 1x1 degree spatial
!resolution and a daily time scale from October 1996 to present.
!The daily data is disaggregated to 3-hourly and finer resolution using 
!the forecast precipitation fields of the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)
!weather forecast model developed at the Environmental Modeling
!Center (EMC) of NOAA/NCEP~\cite{derber}.  
!GDAS variables are produced on a quadratic gaussian grid, whose resolution
!increased from T170, T254, T382, T574, to T1534. The disaggregated GPCP
!precipitation fields change the spatial resolution accordingly.
